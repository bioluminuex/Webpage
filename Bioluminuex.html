<h1>Digital Project</h1>
<p>Wearable Healthcare Device Concentrating On Several Parameters</p>

    <h3>Our Focus</h3>
    <p>
    Our business model was created in early 2019 and got clearance by the endorsing body and the Govt. of UK<br>
    A year later our business model has expanded to serve patients having geriatric, palliative and chronic ailments within the UK<br> 
    Moreover, we are planning to broaden our model to serve and help people<br>
    The initial idea of our model is to include only seven parameters monitoring adopted by NHS to provide emergency response to the local community<br> 
    From here our team has widened the research and added on seventeen parameters to it, wherein our model 1.0 includes nine parameters for the first launch<br>    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-col">
        <h3>Business Model</h3>
        <p>
            Our business model is a product-based service model that includes a wearable monitoring device designed under the combination of embedded techniques and software oriented working model<br>
            The model consist cluster of sensors integrated with AI and ML trained data models which in result provides clinical accurate data of a person’s health status<br>
            Eventually our model act as a digital tool for the doctors to support early intervention especially at circumstances wherein extensive diagnostic facilities are either limited or time consuming<br>
            Although our working model is a continuous active monitoring device, even without the wearable monitoring device (model) the software platform in our device plays a vital role hereby collecting and stores the recent data fed in it at a given point of time to corelate, analyse and provide vital information to doctors<br> 
            Which helps them to find the major conditions or immediate intervention on some minor conditions<br>         
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-col">
            <h3>Business foresight</h3>
            <p>
                Our working model (wearable device) has larger scope in UK where the business organisation is positioned based on UK Govt<br>
                Approval while it can be expanded to several other countries where healthcare is governed and operated by government not limiting to EU, Middle East and many more countries<br> 
                With vast opportunity around the globe, our mission is also to serve for the developing countries via United Nations which is the main custodian of health and welfare<br>
                There will be an exclusive launch in India based on wellness category and this will be explored via collaboration with reputed brand(s). With India being the second populous country, having the highest number of youngsters with busy lifestyle, our product can help them and their family to lead a healthy and safe lifestyle on a daily basis<br>

                <h3>Current Status</h3>
                <p>
                    So far, we have successfully completed testing six parameters, remaining three will be completed by start of January, 2022<br>
                    Our initial version of functional prototype to be ready by Jan 2022<br> 
                    After testing and corrections, our fully functional prototype to be released by May 2022<br>
                    Our team is developing data model for nine parameters individually, combination of these can provide inputs for top 14 diseases in the UK, based on NHS statistics and 4 physical conditions namely geriatric, palliative, prenatal and physical disability under general health category<br>
                    We have applied for intellectual property protection and currently under Provisional application and Prior Art Search in India. This will be extended to other regions of the world especially in the UK, Europe and MENA region before Dec. 2021<br>
